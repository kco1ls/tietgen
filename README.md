Ground up redesign and recode of tietgenkollegiet.dk

- SEO and performance optimized
- Supports all devices and screen sizes
- Migrated over all 170 pages (in both languages)
- Maintained all URL and URL structures, AKA, same links on old website will link to same page on this one.
- Supports English and Danish
- Built on NextJS, ready to be deployed (e.g using vercel)

NOTE: I only had access to the images provided on the original website - they were quite low resolution. If original images exist in high resolution this would drastically improve how the pages look.

I hope you like it. If you want to use it and want help with ANYTHING AT ALL, email me at joko22ab@student.cbs.dk

P.S. I'd like to note I'm definitely more of a programmer than I am a designer ðŸ˜„
