With a depth of up to 8 meters, these boxes are an impressive feat of engineering requiring gathering inspiration from e.g. building bridges in the open sea.</p><h1 class=\"blue\">Materials</h1><p>Besides the characteristic circular shape, one of the most conspicuous elements in the architectural layout of Tietgenkollegiet is the choice of materials.

The official description of the committee is as follows: \u201cThe Recommendation Committee (ISU) represents the residents at the Tietgen Residence Hall, and oversees the selection of responsible, engaged and social students who can support an attractive housing and study environment.</p><p>The committee is responsible for the four yearly application rounds. For each round, the applications are split randomly into two groups, each consisting of three ISU-members. In these groups, the three ISU-members evaluates the applications, and passes on the best 10-15% to the final round, where all six members and the representative from the board reads and evaluates.</p><h1 class=\"brown\">Focus on motivation and diversity</h1><p>During the evaluation of the individual applications, special attention is given to the sections where the applicant describes his or her motivation for living at the Tietgen Residence Hall. The goal is to find applicants who will fit the dorm the best, and who can contribute to making the dorm a great place to live. Because every ISU-member draws from their own experiences and beliefs evaluations are subjective. It is therefore not possible to define what exactly makes \u2018a great application\u2019. However, ISU does evaluate based on the dorms principles of diversity, and aims to select applicants from a wide variety of studies, cultures and interests in every round of applications.</p><h1 class=\"yellow\">Good advice from the recommendation committee</h1><p>There is no definite recipe for the perfect application, because the ISU-members evaluates based on personal experiences and preferences, and seeks diversity in the new residents who are selected.

Most residents find their own subtenants. Please note that there usually only are very few sublets available per term.</p><h1 class=\"blue\">After the end of the sublet</h1><p>Please note that as a subtenant you can only sublet for a period of max. 6 months.</p><p>If you want a residence after the end of the sublet, you have to go through the standard application procedure as all other applicants. People who sublet or have sublet are treated on equal terms with other applicants and are thus moved to the top of the waiting list.</p></div>", "links": [{"label": "Apply and become a resident", "url": "/en/apply-and-become-a-resident/"}, {"label": "Leases and prices", "url": "/en/apply-and-become-a-resident/leases-and-prices/"}, {"label": "Who can apply?", "url": "/en/apply-and-become-a-resident/who-can-apply/"}, {"label": "Selection process", "url": "/en/apply-and-become-a-resident/selection-process/"}, {"label": "Application form", "url": "/en/apply-and-become-a-resident/application-form/"}, {"label": "Moving in", "url": "/en/apply-and-become-a-resident/moving-in/"}, {"label": "Subletting", "url": "/en/apply-and-become-a-resident/subletting/"}, {"label": "Privacy policy for applicants", "url": "/en/apply-and-become-a-resident/privacy-policy-for-applicants/"}], "well": []}, {"url": "apply-and-become-a-resident/privacy-policy-for-applicants", "text": "<h1 class=\"blue\">Privacy policy for applicants</h1><div><p>When applying for a residence at Tietgenkollegiet, we ask you to provide us with a number of information about yourself and your studies.

But as you can see in the photographs, that need not be an obstacle \u2013 on the contrary.</p><h1 class=\"brown\">Room to be yourself</h1><p>Even though Tietgenkollegiet emphasises community a great deal, it is also key that there is room to be yourself. If you need to be alone, there is always the option of retiring to your room, but as the residents say it usually doesn\u2019t take long before you get the urge to open the door to the kitchen again so you can hear what is going on.</p></div>", "links": [{"label": "Living at Tietgenkollegiet", "url": "/en/living-at-tietgenkollegiet/"}, {"label": "This is how we live", "url": "/en/living-at-tietgenkollegiet/this-is-how-we-live/"}, {"label": "The kitchen \u2013 a little family", "url": "/en/living-at-tietgenkollegiet/the-kitchen-a-little-family/"}, {"label": "The committee work", "url": "/en/living-at-tietgenkollegiet/the-committee-work/"}, {"label": "Activities and partying", "url": "/en/living-at-tietgenkollegiet/activities-and-partying/"}, {"label": "An active part of the local community", "url": "/en/living-at-tietgenkollegiet/an-active-part-of-the-local-community/"}, {"label": "International culture", "url": "/en/living-at-tietgenkollegiet/international-culture/"}, {"label": "Tietgen Festival", "url": "/en/living-at-tietgenkollegiet/tietgen-festival/"}], "well": []}, {"url": "living-at-tietgenkollegiet/the-kitchen-a-little-family", "text": "<h1 class=\"blue\">The kitchen \u2013 a little family</h1><div><p>\u201cMy second family\u201d \u2013 that is the way that many residents describe their relationship to those with whom they share a kitchen. A large portion of residence hall living is spent in the kitchen where a lot of other things are going on other than just cooking. But as in all families, people are different and thus there are also challenges to be faced in the common kitchen.</p><blockquote>\u201cThe best part of living at Tietgen is the life in the kitchen. I appreciate having someone to come home to. That there are lovely people with whom you can share your day. It\u2019s really like a sort of family. I have lived here for three years and obviously we have our little ups and downs but you would experience the same in a real family. We get along really well \u2013 we have already planned going to the island of Sams\u00f8 together this summer.\u201d<p class=\"quote-author\">Kasper, resident</p></blockquote><h1 class=\"green\">A close relationship</h1><p>At Tietgenkollegiet there are 12 rooms (of this one double room) connected with one kitchen. It\u2019s something very special to live so closely together with people as you do when sharing a kitchen in a residence hall where things are often done together: hanging out, fun, talking about studies, eating, and watching TV. You get close to each other in a completely different way than if you e.g. only are students together.</p><h1 class=\"brown\">Met with a smile</h1><p>In the kitchen, you share both joys and sorrows. Many residents describe the best thing as the fact that someone is always there ready with a smile in the morning or with caring concern asking how you feel when you are down. Simply put, you care about one another which can be a great joy and support in your daily life.</p><h1 class=\"yellow\">Each kitchen\u2019s own traditions</h1><p>Even though all kitchens as such are the same, they are still very different because the people living there using the kitchen put their stamp on it. In some kitchens, there are organised common dinners almost every night while other kitchens are more spur of the moment in their approach.</p><p>However, some traditions are upheld in all kitchens, including the residence hall classic Tour des Chambres (colloquially referred to as TDC) where you go round to all rooms that on the occasion have been decorated with each its inventive theme.</p><h1 class=\"blue\">Challenges in everyday life</h1><p>When up to 13 different people with different backgrounds, attitudes, and opinions have to live together, it will invariably create challenges. Many residents are faced with different attitudes towards everything from washing dishes to politics and it is not always easy to form a synthesis.</p><p>Thus, in many kitchens there are regular meetings where \u201cthe rules of the game\u201d are discussed and a solution worked out regarding issues that may arise. All this is also part of residence hall living and something of which you have to expect to be part.</p></div>", "links": [{"label": "Living at Tietgenkollegiet", "url": "/en/living-at-tietgenkollegiet/"}, {"label": "This is how we live", "url": "/en/living-at-tietgenkollegiet/this-is-how-we-live/"}, {"label": "The kitchen \u2013 a little family", "url": "/en/living-at-tietgenkollegiet/the-kitchen-a-little-family/"}, {"label": "The committee work", "url": "/en/living-at-tietgenkollegiet/the-committee-work/"}, {"label": "Activities and partying", "url": "/en/living-at-tietgenkollegiet/activities-and-partying/"}, {"label": "An active part of the local community", "url": "/en/living-at-tietgenkollegiet/an-active-part-of-the-local-community/"}, {"label": "International culture", "url": "/en/living-at-tietgenkollegiet/international-culture/"}, {"label": "Tietgen Festival", "url": "/en/living-at-tietgenkollegiet/tietgen-festival/"}], "well": []}, {"url": "living-at-tietgenkollegiet/the-committee-work", "text": "<h1 class=\"blue\">The committee work</h1><div><p>Volunteer committee work in the residents\u2019 democracy is the core of a well-functioning residence hall and that is also the way it is at Tietgenkollegiet. The residence hall is constantly evolving and we expect all residents to pitch in \u2013 not because you \u201cshould\u201d but because it is fun and because you want to be part of making Tietgenkollegiet a better place to live.</p><h1 class=\"green\">A road to participatory democracy and a better residence hall life</h1><p>The residents\u2019 democracy and committee work give the residents access to participatory democracy at a general level. If there is something you want to create, change, or support, then there is always ample opportunity to carry this out \u2013 often with help and support from the other residents and the administration.</p><h1 class=\"brown\">New competences \u2013 new friends</h1><p>Participating in the residents\u2019 democracy and committee work does by no means have to be a dreaded chore. On the contrary, this is a great opportunity either to work with something that you are interested in or to develop new competences. And when you work together on a project across kitchens you keep meeting new, interesting people. All of which is part of contributing to an even closer attachment to the residence hall.</p><h1 class=\"yellow\">The residence hall council \u2013 the focal point of residents\u2019 democracy</h1><p>In the Residence Hall Council subjects pertaining to all residents are discussed and experiences are shared across the kitchens. Officially, the Residence Hall Council consists of 30 representatives \u2013 one from each kitchen \u2013 and a supervisory body, the executive committee consisting of five members elected by the residents. At the monthly meetings, typically the various committee chairmen as well as a representative of the administration will attend.</p><h1 class=\"blue\">A committee for every cause \u2013 and conviction</h1><p>The committee structure of Tietgenkollegiet is dynamic and continually developing depending on the people who participate. Thus, there is ample opportunity to contribute with exactly what you want. At the time of writing, there are more than 10 active committees that each work with the various parts of residence hall living \u2013 both the more formal, e.g. the Recommendation Committee that carefully scrutinises all applications, and the more lively, e.g. the Bar Committee that not surprisingly is one of the most popular committees.</p></div>", "links": [{"label": "Living at Tietgenkollegiet", "url": "/en/living-at-tietgenkollegiet/"}, {"label": "This is how we live", "url": "/en/living-at-tietgenkollegiet/this-is-how-we-live/"}, {"label": "The kitchen \u2013 a little family", "url": "/en/living-at-tietgenkollegiet/the-kitchen-a-little-family/"}, {"label": "The committee work", "url": "/en/living-at-tietgenkollegiet/the-committee-work/"}, {"label": "Activities and partying", "url": "/en/living-at-tietgenkollegiet/activities-and-partying/"}, {"label": "An active part of the local community", "url": "/en/living-at-tietgenkollegiet/an-active-part-of-the-local-community/"}, {"label": "International culture", "url": "/en/living-at-tietgenkollegiet/international-culture/"}, {"label": "Tietgen Festival", "url": "/en/living-at-tietgenkollegiet/tietgen-festival/"}], "well": []}, {"url": "living-at-tietgenkollegiet/activities-and-partying", "text": "<h1 class=\"blue\">Activities and partying</h1><div><p>When you live with 390 other young people, there is always something to do, whether you are into sports and exercise, board games and hanging out, or partying and a good time.</p><h1 class=\"green\">Activities</h1><p>Tietgenkollegiet always has a number of activity groups that work on coordinating the various interests among the residents. The activity groups are e.g. a number of sports associations, including a running club and obviously the residence hall football team, C.F.

The other activities offered vary depending on whether someone takes the initiative to launch something.</p><h1 class=\"brown\">The caf\u00e9</h1><p>Throughout the year, the residence hall has held a weekly caf\u00e9 night in the assembly hall where there are little cosy tables and candles. The volunteers of the caf\u00e9 bake cakes and serve tea and coffee and other delicacies.

Thus as a resident, you get ample opportunity to get to know other cultures \u2013 and it\u2019s also a good opportunity to work on your English.</p><blockquote>\u201cMeeting exchange students is one of the best things about the residence hall: One summer we travelled in California and arrived one morning to Los Angeles. Before we had gotten a chance to find a hotel, news spread like wildfire through the city: Michael Jackson had died at the local hospital. A few hours later the city was filled to the brim with fans and reporters. No vacancies! Through Facebook we got in touch with a former exchange student from Tietgenkollegiet, and he put us up for the night on air mattresses and gave us a tour of Hollywood and the area.\u201d<p class=\"quote-author\">Asger and Mona, residents</p></blockquote><h1 class=\"green\">A meeting between people from all parts of the world</h1><p>Overall, there are just about 60 international students at Tietgenkollegiet which means that 2 out of 12 rooms connected with most kitchens are rented out to exchange students. Often, the exchange students are only in Denmark for one term but this does not mean that they do not have time to become part of the residence hall life. On the contrary, many exchange students are often very interested in participating in the community and thus many have time to form close relationships with the other residents \u2013 relationships that last even after the end of exchange stay where you try to stay in contact, e.g. via Facebook or even by visiting each other.</p><h1 class=\"brown\">International communication</h1><p>Danish is quite a difficult language to master and even though many exchange students attend the Danish classes recommended by the universities, most communication is in English. This also applies to kitchens where many of the messages in the kitchen book is written in both Danish and English just as an effort is often made to include exchange students in common dinners by speaking English.</p><h1 class=\"yellow\">Get to know your own culture</h1><p>An extra advantage of housing an exchange student is that you get a new perspective on your own life as a student in Copenhagen. For example, many residents describe how they suddenly discover new and exciting things in Copenhagen because they are giving their international neighbours a tour of the city.</p></div>", "links": [{"label": "Living at Tietgenkollegiet", "url": "/en/living-at-tietgenkollegiet/"}, {"label": "This is how we live", "url": "/en/living-at-tietgenkollegiet/this-is-how-we-live/"}, {"label": "The kitchen \u2013 a little family", "url": "/en/living-at-tietgenkollegiet/the-kitchen-a-little-family/"}, {"label": "The committee work", "url": "/en/living-at-tietgenkollegiet/the-committee-work/"}, {"label": "Activities and partying", "url": "/en/living-at-tietgenkollegiet/activities-and-partying/"}, {"label": "An active part of the local community", "url": "/en/living-at-tietgenkollegiet/an-active-part-of-the-local-community/"}, {"label": "International culture", "url": "/en/living-at-tietgenkollegiet/international-culture/"}, {"label": "Tietgen Festival", "url": "/en/living-at-tietgenkollegiet/tietgen-festival/"}], "well": []}, {"url": "change-of-telephone-system", "text": "<h1 class=\"blue\">Change of telephone system</h1><div><div> Posted on <time>22.
